        <p>Welcome to Wild Rescues. 
        Our mission is to rescue, rehabilitate, and release wildlife
        back into their natural environment. We are a nonprofit organization
        dedicated to helping injured wildlife.</p>
        <p> Our staff provide around-the-clock care for wildlife in need. We
        also provide long-term care for wildlife that cannot be released back
        into their natural environment. </p>
        <p>Will you partner with us? We need caring volunteers to help care for
        our animals. You can also donate, become a member, or become a sponsor.
        Contact us today.</p>
